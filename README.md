# Why the #### did you guys make this?
Well, we needed to finish a coding project for school in three weeks and unlike the others i didn't want to end up with only half a game or a half finished blender movie, so we made half of a website.
# What is the theme?
The thema was decided by the teachers, the project needed to be about water, things like water hygiene and flood warnings, so we made a website with the weather and a calculator.
